# Starship Strike by Joel Henningsen
I have space shooting game where the player races through space firing at enemies. The enemies slowly get closer to the user, and the user
must destroy all enemies before they reach the player or their side of the screen.

## Controls
Run main.py to play the game. Arrow keys (UP) and (DOWN) control the main menu, and you can press "ENTER/RETURN" to select an option.
While playing the game, the (UP) and (DOWN) keys move the player's spaceship vertically, and you can press "SPACE" to shoot!

## Goal
The goal of the game is to destroy as many enemies as you can before they reach your side of the screen. Killing an enemy will add 1 
to your score counter! If you get a new high score, you will be prompted to go to the console/terminal and enter your name. After,
return to the program and see your name in the hall of fame!

## Notes
I did my best to complete the game and get it working to the best of my ability. As you know, I had emailed you about a family emergency,
which sadly got in the way of the progress for my game. Some thing to consider:

You are able to view the high score screen from the main menu, and press (ESC) to return to the main menu. However, once a player has 
completed a round of gameplay and views the high score screen, they are stuck in a loop and cannot return. This was a bug that I simply 
could not figure out how to fix. If you want to play again, you'll just have to restart the program. But don't worry, your high score 
is saved!

P.S. If you have any idea how to fix the loop where you are stuck in the high score screen I would love to know how to fix it, it drove me
CRAZY!

Thank you for playing!!
