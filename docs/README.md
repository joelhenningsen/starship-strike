# Starship Strike by Joel Henningsen
I have space shooting game where the player races through space firing at enemies. The enemies slowly get closer to the user, and the user
must destroy all enemies before they reach the player or their side of the screen.

## Controls
Run main.py to play the game. Arrow keys (UP) and (DOWN) control the main menu, and you can press "ENTER/RETURN" to select an option.
While playing the game, the (UP) and (DOWN) keys move the player's spaceship vertically, and you can press "SPACE" to shoot!

## Goal
The goal of the game is to destroy as many enemies as you can before they reach your side of the screen. Killing an enemy will add 1 
to your score counter! If you get a new high score, you will be prompted to go to the console/terminal and enter your name. After,
return to the program and see your name in the hall of fame!


Thank you for playing!!
